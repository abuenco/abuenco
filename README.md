Hi, Iâ€™m Andie! Here you'll find some of my personal coding projects that I've done for myself or for friends in my spare time. 

ðŸ“¸ Recently, I've gotten into photography, so my current project (when I'm not taking or editing photos) 
is to develop some tools to improve my workflow from camera capture to editing on my computer to (potentially) printing photos.
